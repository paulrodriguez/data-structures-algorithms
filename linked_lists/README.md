# DEFINITION

A linked list is a linear data structure that to store a collection of elements.
each element, or node, points to the next element in the list, so position is not by how they are placed in memory, but where the next element points to in memory.

they are dynamic as inserting a new element only requires changing pointers of previous element and newly inserted element, and similar logic applies when deleting an element.

# TIME COMPLEXITY
